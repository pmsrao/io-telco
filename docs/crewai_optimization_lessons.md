# CrewAI Agent Optimization Lessons Learned

## Overview

This document captures the key lessons learned while optimizing the CrewAI agent for complex multi-entity GraphQL queries in the Telecom Data Product runtime system.

## Problem Statement

The initial CrewAI implementation was experiencing:
- **Infinite loops** with 18+ tool calls
- **Malformed GraphQL queries** with syntax errors
- **Poor performance** taking several minutes to complete
- **Agent narrowness** due to rigid query building tools
- **Inconsistent results** for complex multi-entity queries

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Agent Selection is Critical

**Problem**: All queries were being routed to CrewAI, even simple ones.

**Solution**: Implement intelligent agent selection based on query complexity.

```python
def _is_simple_query(self, user_input: str) -> bool:
    # Check for complex patterns that require CrewAI
    complex_patterns = [
        r'\b(and|or|with|including|also|additionally)\b',  # Multiple conditions
        r'\b(compare|comparison|versus|vs)\b',  # Comparisons
        r'\b(aggregate|sum|total|count|average|max|min)\b',  # Aggregations
        # ... more patterns
    ]
    
    # Only count as multiple entities if they're the main subject, not filters
    # e.g., "payments for account" = single entity (payments)
    # "customers and payments" = multiple entities
```

**Lesson**: Route simple queries to fast, reliable agents. Reserve CrewAI for truly complex scenarios.

### 2. CrewAI Workflow Simplification

**Problem**: Complex multi-agent workflows with 5+ tasks were causing performance issues.

**Solution**: Streamline to minimal viable workflow.

**Before**:
```python
tasks=[plan_task, query_task, execute_task, correlate_task, compose_task]
agents=[planner_agent, query_agent, composer_agent]
max_iter=10
```

**After**:
```python
tasks=[query_task]  # Single task - build and execute
agents=[query_agent]  # Only query agent
max_iter=2  # Minimal iterations
```

**Lesson**: Start with the simplest workflow that works, then add complexity only if needed.

### 3. Tool Input Format Handling

**Problem**: CrewAI agents were passing malformed parameters to tools.

**Solution**: Add explicit parameter format instructions in agent backstories.

```python
backstory="""
IMPORTANT: When using tools, pass parameters as simple strings:
- For graphql_query_builder, use intent="ACTUAL USER QUERY HERE", contract_data="contract json", schema_data=""

CRITICAL: Always use the ACTUAL user query in the intent parameter, not "user query"!

EXAMPLE: If user asks "show me all customers in India with unpaid bills and their payment history",
then use intent="show me all customers in India with unpaid bills and their payment history"
NOT intent="Get all customers with their latest bills and payments"
"""
```

**Lesson**: Be explicit about parameter formats. Agents need clear, specific instructions.

### 4. Multi-Entity Query Detection Logic

**Problem**: Query builder was not properly detecting multi-entity queries.

**Solution**: Force multi-entity queries to use the simple query builder.

```python
# Check if this is a multi-entity query
entities = intent_info.get('entities', [])
if len(entities) > 1:
    # Multi-entity queries should use the simple query builder
    return self._build_simple_query(intent_info)
```

**Lesson**: Don't rely on complex contract matching for multi-entity queries. Use direct query building.

### 5. GraphQL Query Syntax Validation

**Problem**: Generated queries had syntax errors like empty filter parameters.

**Solution**: Implement proper conditional query building.

```python
# Build query with proper syntax
if filter_args:
    filters_str = f"filters: {{ {', '.join(filter_args)} }}"
    query = f"""
    query {operation}($account_id: String, $country: String, $status: String, $bill_status: String, $from_time: String, $to_time: String) {{
        {operation}({filters_str}, limit: 50) {{
            {fields}
        }}
    }}
    """
else:
    query = f"""
    query {operation} {{
        {operation}(limit: 50) {{
            {fields}
        }}
    }}
    """
```

**Lesson**: Always validate query syntax. Handle empty filters gracefully.

### 6. Intent Parsing Robustness

**Problem**: Intent parsing was too rigid and missed edge cases.

**Solution**: Implement flexible pattern matching with fallbacks.

```python
def _parse_intent(self, intent: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    intent_lower = intent.lower()
    
    # Extract entity types with better pattern matching
    entities = []
    if any(word in intent_lower for word in ['payment', 'payments', 'payment history']):
        entities.append('payments')
    if any(word in intent_lower for word in ['bill', 'bills', 'unpaid bills', 'unpaid bill']):
        entities.append('bills')
    if any(word in intent_lower for word in ['customer', 'customers', 'all customers']):
        entities.append('customer_profile')
    
    # For complex queries, try to infer multiple entities
    if 'and' in intent_lower or 'with' in intent_lower:
        # If query mentions multiple concepts, include relevant entities
        if 'customer' in intent_lower and 'payment' in intent_lower:
            if 'customer_profile' not in entities:
                entities.append('customer_profile')
            if 'payments' not in entities:
                entities.append('payments')
    
    # If no entities found, default to payments for general queries
    if not entities:
        entities.append('payments')
```

**Lesson**: Use flexible pattern matching with intelligent fallbacks. Don't be too strict.

### 7. Performance Optimization Strategies

**Problem**: CrewAI agents were making too many tool calls.

**Solution**: Implement multiple optimization strategies.

1. **Rate Limiting**: `max_rpm=500`
2. **Iteration Limits**: `max_iter=2`
3. **Tool Call Reduction**: Combine multiple operations into single tool calls
4. **Early Termination**: Stop on first successful result

**Lesson**: Performance optimization requires multiple strategies working together.

### 8. Error Handling and Fallbacks

**Problem**: JSON parsing errors and malformed contract data were causing failures.

**Solution**: Implement robust error handling with fallbacks.

```python
try:
    contract = json.loads(contract_data)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    # If parsing fails, create a simple default contract
    print(f"JSON parsing error: {e}")
    contract = {
        "entities": {
            "payments": {
                "aliases": ["list_payments"],
                "columns": {
                    "payment_id": "String",
                    "account_id": "String", 
                    "amount": "Decimal",
                    "status": "String",
                    "created_at": "Timestamp"
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

**Lesson**: Always have fallback mechanisms. Don't let parsing errors break the entire flow.

## Conclusion

The key to successful CrewAI optimization is:

2. **Simplified workflows** - Less is often more
3. **Explicit instructions** - Don't leave behavior to chance
4. **Robust error handling** - Plan for failure
5. **Performance monitoring** - Measure and optimize continuously

These lessons can be applied to other CrewAI implementations to avoid common pitfalls and achieve better performance.
