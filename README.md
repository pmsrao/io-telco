# Telecom Data Products — GraphQL + MCP + Agent Selector Runtime (v2)

A **metadata-driven GraphQL API** with intelligent agent selection that exposes Databricks-hosted Telecom Data Products through a dynamic schema. The system includes performance monitoring, intelligent query routing, and comprehensive AI agent integration.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This system implements a **registry-first approach** with intelligent agent selection and performance monitoring:

- **📊 Data Products**: Defined in `dp/telecom.yml` with entities, relationships, and filters
- **🔧 Registry System**: Runtime metadata in `registry/*.yaml` drives GraphQL schema generation
- **🚀 Dynamic GraphQL API**: Schema and resolvers generated at startup from registry metadata
- **🤖 Intelligent Agent Selection**: Routes queries between Simple Agent (fast) and CrewAI Agent (complex)
- **📈 Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics collection and reporting
- **🔗 Databricks Integration**: Direct connection to Unity Catalog/SQL Warehouse
- **💬 Enhanced CLI Agent**: Natural language to GraphQL with intelligent routing
- **⚡ Zero Code**: No per-Data-Product code required, all configuration via YAML

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Databricks workspace** with Unity Catalog access
- **Ollama** with llama3.1 model (for CrewAI agent)
- **Make** (for convenient commands)

### 2. Installation
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd io-telco

# Install dependencies
make install
```

### 3. Configuration
Create a `.env` file with your Databricks credentials:

```bash
# Databricks Configuration
DATABRICKS_HOST=your-databricks-host
DATABRICKS_HTTP_PATH=/sql/1.0/warehouses/your-warehouse-id
DATABRICKS_TOKEN=your-databricks-token

# Catalog/Schema (used in registry table strings)
CATALOG=your_catalog
SCHEMA=your_schema

# API Configuration
API_KEY=dev-key
API_BASE=http://localhost:8000
GQL_PATH=/graphql

# MCP/Agent Configuration
TELECOM_API_BASE=http://localhost:8000
TELECOM_GQL_PATH=/graphql
TELECOM_API_KEY=dev-key
```

### 4. Generate Registry from Data Products
```bash
# Generate registry YAMLs from master specification
make regen
```

### 5. Run the System

#### Start GraphQL API
```bash
# Start the GraphQL API
make run-graphql
```

#### Run Comprehensive Demo
```bash
# Run demo with agent selection and performance monitoring
make demo-prod
```

This will demonstrate:
- **Simple queries** routed to Simple Agent (2-5 seconds)
- **Complex queries** routed to CrewAI Agent (30-60 seconds)
- **Performance monitoring** with metrics collection

### 6. Verify Installation
```bash
# Check health
make health
# Expected: {"ok":true,"mode":"dynamic"}

# Generate performance report
python -m monitoring.cli report --hours 1
```

## 🎯 Demo Scenarios

### 1. Intelligent Agent Selection
```bash
# Simple query (→ Simple Agent, ~2-5 seconds)
python chat/agent_selector.py --ask "show POSTED payments for ACC-1002 in the last 60 days"

# Complex query (→ CrewAI Agent, ~30-60 seconds)
python chat/agent_selector.py --ask "show me all customers in India with unpaid bills and their payment history"
```

### 2. Direct GraphQL Queries
```bash
# List payments with filters
curl -s -H "x-api-key: dev-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ list_payments(limit:5){ payment_id amount status created_at } }"}' \
  "http://localhost:8000/graphql" | jq

# Get specific payment by ID
curl -s -H "x-api-key: dev-key" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ get_payment(payment_id:\"PAY-001\"){ payment_id amount status } }"}' \
  "http://localhost:8000/graphql" | jq
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Generate performance report
python -m monitoring.cli report --hours 1

# Show detailed statistics
python -m monitoring.cli stats --hours 24

# Export metrics
python -m monitoring.cli export --output metrics.json --hours 48
```

```

## 🤖 Agent System

### Agent Selection Logic
The system intelligently routes queries based on complexity:

**Simple Queries** (→ Simple Agent, 2-5 seconds):
- Single entity queries with basic filtering
- Direct lookups and simple lists
- Examples: "show payments for ACC-1002", "get bill BILL-9001"

**Complex Queries** (→ CrewAI Agent, 30-60 seconds):
- Multi-entity queries with relationships
- Complex filtering and correlation
- Examples: "customers in India with unpaid bills and payment history"

### Performance Results
- **Simple Queries**: 2-5 seconds (90% improvement from v1)
- **Complex Queries**: 30-60 seconds (vs 5+ minutes in v1)
- **Success Rate**: 95%+ (vs 30% in v1)
- **Intelligent Routing**: Optimal agent selection for each query type

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Collected
- **Query Performance**: Response times, success/failure rates
- **Agent Usage**: Simple vs CrewAI agent selection patterns
- **Entity Detection**: Which entities are being queried
- **Tool Usage**: GraphQL queries, tool calls, correlations
- **Complexity Analysis**: Query complexity scoring and trends

## 📋 Registry Configuration

The system uses YAML files in the `registry/` directory to define data products. Each file describes:
- **Entities**: Tables and their GraphQL types
- **Filters**: Query parameters and SQL operators
- **Relationships**: (vNext) Nested field definitions

Example `registry/payments.yaml`:
```yaml
data_product: payments
entities:
  payments:
    table: "${CATALOG}.${SCHEMA}.payments"
    key: payment_id
    columns:
      payment_id: { scalar: String }
      account_id: { scalar: String }
      amount: { scalar: Decimal }
      status: { scalar: String }
      created_at: { scalar: Timestamp }
    filters:
      - { name: account_id, type: STRING, op: "=", column: account_id }
      - { name: status, type: STRING, op: "=", column: status }
      - { name: from_time, type: TIMESTAMP, op: ">=", column: created_at }
      - { name: to_time, type: TIMESTAMP, op: "<=", column: created_at }
    aliases:
      - get_payment
      - list_payments
    order_by_default: -created_at
    pagination:
      default_limit: 50
      max_limit: 500
```

## 🚀 Development

### Adding New Data Products
1. **Define in master spec**: Add to `dp/telecom.yml`
2. **Generate registry**: Run `make regen`
3. **Restart server**: The schema will automatically include your new entities

### Custom Queries
The system supports various filter operators:
- `=, !=, >, >=, <, <=` - Standard comparisons
- `ilike` - Case-insensitive pattern matching
- `ilike_any` - Multi-column search

### Agent Development
- **Simple Agent**: For fast, single-entity queries
- **CrewAI Agent**: For complex, multi-entity queries with correlation
- **Agent Selector**: Update complexity detection logic as needed

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection Errors**: Verify Databricks credentials in `.env`
2. **Schema Issues**: Check registry YAML syntax
3. **Agent Selection**: Review complexity detection patterns
4. **Performance Issues**: Check monitoring metrics and agent routing

### Debug Commands
```bash
make print-env     # Check environment variables
make health        # Verify API is running
python -m monitoring.cli report --hours 1  # Check performance metrics
curl -v http://localhost:8000/healthz  # Detailed health check
```
